# Crop Recommendation Dataset
Maximize agricultural yield by recommending appropriate crops

Precision agriculture is in trend nowadays. It helps the farmers to get informed decision about the farming strategy. Here, I present you a dataset which would allow the users to build a predictive model to recommend the most suitable crops to grow in a particular farm based on various parameters.

Data fields
* `N` - ratio of Nitrogen content in soil
* `P` - ratio of Phosphorus content in soil
* `K` - ratio of Potassium content in soil
* `temperature` - temperature in degrees Celsius
* `humidity` - relative humidity in %
* `pH` - ph value of the soil
* `rainfall` - rainfall in mm

* In addition to the `label`, which is the recommended crop to be cultivated under these conditions
